Dubbed one of Key West&rsquo;s eeriest artifacts, Robert is a 3-foot straw-stuffed doll that resembles a naval officer and rumored to be made with voodoo magic. Legend has it that Robert the Doll absorbed the bad temper of his former owner artist <a href=\"http://www.keywestparanormal.com/Locations/RobertTheDoll.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Robert &ldquo;Gene&rdquo; Otto</a>. When Gene died in 1974, Robert was moved to his current home and now haunts the visitors of the museum. Only the brave-hearted dare to take his photo&mdash;many say he curses the families of those who don&rsquo;t ask politely for his photo.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.fortzacharytaylor.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong> Fort Zachary Taylor</strong></a><br /> You may know <a href=\"http://www.fortzacharytaylor.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fort Zachary Taylor</a> as local spot to visit with your family for a relaxing beach day, but it also has a haunted past.
