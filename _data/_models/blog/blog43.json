  "more_content": "<p>There are so many things to do and see in Key West, and the opportunities for island adventures and tours are limitless. Our focus today is all about the food and drink tours that mix up Key West history in a crafty, cool way. Eat and drink like a local as we tour some of the best Key West tours in paradise:</p>\n<h1>Key West Brewery Tours</h1>\n<p>You don&rsquo;t have to go far for this tour as it is steps from The Marker Resort. Adjacent to our hotel is the Key West Waterfront Brewery, a local brewery and restaurant on the water at the historic seaport. In addition to the beer tours, this waterfront restaurant has some spectacular views of schooners, boats, and marina, especially at sunset. It offers something for everyone and is a kid-friendly, family friendly Key West restaurant that just happens to make beer in great location.</p>\n<h4>About the Beer &amp; Tour</h4>\n<p>They have a rotating selection of beers brewed on-site, and a few of The Waterfront Brewery featured signature beers include:</p>\n<p><strong>Crazy Lady, Blonde Ale Brewed with Local Honey</strong></p>\n<p>A nice clean ale with a subtle honey-like sweetness that lingers just long enough. In its first brew, this beer took 2nd at the 2015 Best Florida Beer Championship Specialty Ale Category losing only to Hunahpu, the most sought-after beer made in Florida.</p>\n<p><strong>Lazy Way IPA, American IPA</strong></p>\n<p>A medium-bodied lightly toasted IPA with a malt character and a balanced bitterness. The piney hop notes carry through to the flavor. Finishes crisp and fairly dry.</p>\n<p><strong>Island Life Lager, American Lager</strong></p>\n<p>Standard American Lagers are the &ldquo;regular&rdquo; strength versions of the light American lagers. The style guidelines for this beer are almost identical as those for the light versions. The only difference is that the hop bitterness may go up to the medium-low level, the body is light instead of very light, and of course, the standard versions have higher calories and gravities.</p>\n<p><strong>Key West Brewery Tours</strong> are 30 - 45 minutes long, scheduled for Thursday and Fridays at 5 pm and 2 pm every Saturday and Sunday. You&rsquo;ll not only grab some fun facts about beer, but you&rsquo;ll also walk about with a souvenir Waterfront Brewery Pint Glass. The cost for the tour is $15.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Learn more about The Waterfront Brewery\" href=\"http://www.thewaterfrontbrewery.com/tours/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Learn more about The Waterfront Brewery</a> and see how drinking and learning go hand in hand!
