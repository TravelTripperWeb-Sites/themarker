Let's figure out what all these moons mean when it comes to planning your next couples escape.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Earlymoons</h3>\n<p>Have you heard of this one - the earlymoon?&nbsp; It's another new way for couples to travel and get away from the stress of wedding planning before the big day.&nbsp; These are short quick trips planned by the couple, and it's filled with activities and adventures they desire.&nbsp; A great way to unplug and reconnect.&nbsp; Earlymoon is just another good reason for a quick trip without worrying about the laundry list of wedding to do's.</p>\n<p><img id=\"1537521537776\" class=\" \" src=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_388_19151/media/2018-09-21-051837/large_babymoon-pic2.jpg\" alt=\"EarlyMoons\" data-image-large=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_388_19151/media/2018-09-21-051837/large_babymoon-pic2.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_388_19151/media/2018-09-21-051837/medium_babymoon-pic2.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_388_19151/media/2018-09-21-051837/small_babymoon-pic2.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_388_19151/media/2018-09-21-051837/xsmall_babymoon-pic2.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_388_19151/media/2018-09-21-051837/thumb_babymoon-pic2.jpg\" /></p>\n<h3>Minimoons</h3>\n<p>The mini moon is a perfect way to chill out after the stressful wedding planning.&nbsp; Instead of taking an extended or long vacation/honeymoon, the newly married couple takes a short vacation after the I Do's and a longer one would take place at a later time.&nbsp; After your friends, relatives, and guests leave the celebration, three or four days of \"we time\" is time well spent.</p>\n<h3>ManyMoons</h3>\n<p>Why take just one trip to celebrate and why didn&rsquo;t we think about this a long time ago.&nbsp; Instead of honeymooning for one or two weeks, couples are planning multiple smaller trips throughout the year.&nbsp; Sounds like a good idea to us!&nbsp; &nbsp;If you plan it right, you just may be visiting us again to celebrate your one year anniversary!</p>\n<p><img id=\"1537521500629\" class=\" \" src=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_388_19151/media/2018-09-21-051751/large_babymoon-pic3.jpg\" alt=\"ManyMoons\" data-image-large=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_388_19151/media/2018-09-21-051751/large_babymoon-pic3.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_388_19151/media/2018-09-21-051751/medium_babymoon-pic3.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_388_19151/media/2018-09-21-051751/small_babymoon-pic3.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_388_19151/media/2018-09-21-051751/xsmall_babymoon-pic3.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_388_19151/media/2018-09-21-051751/thumb_babymoon-pic3.jpg\" /></p>\n<h3>BabyMoons</h3>\n<p>Time to plan the great escape for you and your husband before the baby's due date.&nbsp; It's a babymoon vacation and a way for you to enjoy alone time, extra pampering and one last adventure before the little one arrives.&nbsp; It is your first family vacation without having to worry about the kids.&nbsp; Sleep in, go sailing, swimming, eat out, see a play, visit the museums, go for a bike ride, get a massage or do nothing.&nbsp; This vacation has only one itinerary, and it's all up to you to decide when and where you want to go.&nbsp; Just make sure you pick the location that&rsquo;s got everything you need and is close to everything you want and desire.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>BuddyMoons</h3>\n<p>Let's hear it for our Besties!&nbsp; The buddymoon is where the bride and groom invite their best friends to join them for vacation.&nbsp; &nbsp;There&rsquo;s nothing better than getting away with your best buds and the ones you love.</p>\n<p><img id=\"1537521419444\" class=\" \" src=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_388_19151/media/2018-09-21-051648/large_babymoon-pic4.jpg\" alt=\"BuddyMoons\" data-image-large=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_388_19151/media/2018-09-21-051648/large_babymoon-pic4.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_388_19151/media/2018-09-21-051648/medium_babymoon-pic4.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_388_19151/media/2018-09-21-051648/small_babymoon-pic4.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_388_19151/media/2018-09-21-051648/xsmall_babymoon-pic4.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_388_19151/media/2018-09-21-051648/thumb_babymoon-pic4.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Photo Credit: @k2therain on Instagram</p>\n<h3>Familymoons</h3>\n<p>Familymoons are an excellent way for newly blended families to bond together, create memories and experiences that will last a lifetime.&nbsp; Find a destination that is family-friendly with activities and adventures for all.&nbsp; You might even want to include the grandparents on this trip; it's up to you.</p>\n<p><img id=\"1537521392307\" class=\" \" src=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_388_19151/media/2018-09-21-051611/large_babymoon-pic5.jpg\" alt=\"Familymoons\" data-image-large=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_388_19151/media/2018-09-21-051611/large_babymoon-pic5.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_388_19151/media/2018-09-21-051611/medium_babymoon-pic5.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_388_19151/media/2018-09-21-051611/small_babymoon-pic5.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_388_19151/media/2018-09-21-051611/xsmall_babymoon-pic5.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_388_19151/media/2018-09-21-051611/thumb_babymoon-pic5.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Photo Credit: @kristally on Instagram @themarkerresort</p>\n<h3>Why the Marker Resort is the perfect destination for any moon.</h3>\n<p>Whatever vacation moon you plan on taking make sure the destination and location of the hotel are the perfect fit.&nbsp;
