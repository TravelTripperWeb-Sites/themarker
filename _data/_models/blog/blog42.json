So if you have a larger group, you can rent additional tikis and cruise together.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re looking for new things to do in Key West consider bar hopping in a floating tiki boat!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>REVIEWS&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>What a wondrous tiki cruise we had with Captain Dustin! We saw dolphins frolicking in the sea. We ordered carry out from Mellow Ventures Cafe for a fabulous dinner.

We LOVED this!!! We booked early because we had 6 in our party and wanted to be all together and at the time they only had 1 boat. We actually ordered food from the little restaurant they docked at and took it the boat with us (it was yummy). I know some people don't like that you have to bring your own alcohol, but our group loved that, we got it cheaper and also got what they liked! We loved all that- then the ride itself was amazing. Looking at the cool boats in the water and the captain explaining that people lived on them and how that all works, and also the cool animals you see were very nice. But going by Mallory Square with our music (oh yeah, our group loved that they could Bluetooth our own tunes on the boat!) up and dancing and waving to all the people out there to watch a sunset - it was really cool and being on the water for the sunset was just BEAUTIFUL! I cannot recommend this enough, it was fun, and something different than you will ever experience. ~ DawnShip via <a title=\"TripAdvisor\" href=\"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34345-d13413969-r575705046-Cruisin_Tikis_KeyWest-Key_West_Florida_Keys_Florida.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TripAdvisor</a></p>\n<p><img id=\"1525856968682\" class=\" \" src=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/202_388_15408/media/2018-05-09-050847/new-in-town-pic3.jpg\" alt=\"people review\" data-image-large=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/202_388_15408/media/2018-05-09-050847/large_new-in-town-pic3.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/202_388_15408/media/2018-05-09-050847/medium_new-in-town-pic3.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/202_388_15408/media/2018-05-09-050847/small_new-in-town-pic3.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/202_388_15408/media/2018-05-09-050847/xsmall_new-in-town-pic3.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/202_388_15408/media/2018-05-09-050847/thumb_new-in-town-pic3.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Photo via Dawn Ship on TripAdvisor</p>\n<h3>Here are 3 Cruisin Tiki Boat Tours To Consider</h3>\n<p>The cruises mentioned below depart from Mellow Ventures which is also the home of&nbsp; <a title=\"Mellow Ventures Cafe and Gastropub\" href=\"http://mellowventureskeywest.com/mellow-ventures-cafe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mellow Ventures Cafe and Gastropub</a> where you can grab food and drink for the ride.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Sunset Cruise</h4>\n<p>Take in the sunset without the crowds and sit back, relax and enjoy a 120-minute cruise around the harbor passing Sunset Pier,&nbsp; Mallory Square and ending with a spectacular Key West sunset.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Bar Stop Cruise&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>Bar Hopping By The Floating Tikii, Yes you can!&nbsp; This 150 minute bar hopping cruise leaves from Mellow Cafe and one additional bar stop at Lagerheads Beach Bar.&nbsp; Stops are subject to change due to docking locations or weather.&nbsp; Cruise around the island and hop off to get a cocktail at one of our cool beach bars on the island.</p>\n<p><img id=\"1525857030484\" class=\" \" src=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/202_388_15408/media/2018-05-09-051007/new-in-town-pic4.jpg\" alt=\"Bar Stop Cruise\" data-image-large=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/202_388_15408/media/2018-05-09-051007/large_new-in-town-pic4.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/202_388_15408/media/2018-05-09-051007/medium_new-in-town-pic4.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/202_388_15408/media/2018-05-09-051007/small_new-in-town-pic4.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/202_388_15408/media/2018-05-09-051007/xsmall_new-in-town-pic4.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/202_388_15408/media/2018-05-09-051007/thumb_new-in-town-pic4.jpg\" />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Photo credit Cruisin Tiki Key West&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Seaport Cruise</h4>\n<p>Enjoy the 120 minute Key West Seaport sightseeing trip and learn interesting Key West fun facts and history while enjoying the views.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All of the above deliver another Key West travel experience to remember.&nbsp; If you love being on the water and don&rsquo;t want to be on one of the larger tour boats, this is a must do!</p>\n<p><img id=\"1525857094043\" class=\" \" src=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/202_388_15408/media/2018-05-09-051122/new-in-town-last-pic.jpg\" alt=\"Seaport Cruise\" data-image-large=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/202_388_15408/media/2018-05-09-051122/large_new-in-town-last-pic.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/202_388_15408/media/2018-05-09-051122/medium_new-in-town-last-pic.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/202_388_15408/media/2018-05-09-051122/small_new-in-town-last-pic.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/202_388_15408/media/2018-05-09-051122/xsmall_new-in-town-last-pic.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/202_388_15408/media/2018-05-09-051122/thumb_new-in-town-last-pic.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Photo credit Cruisin Tiki Key West&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Floating Tiki Boat Tours, Know before you go.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>The Tiki Boat is NOT equipped with restrooms, holds six passengers.
