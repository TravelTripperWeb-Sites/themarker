Historically, there have been two Key West natives to compete in the games; <a href=\"http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/friv/birthplaces.cgi?id=13157\">Rod Davis</a>, who competed in sailing, and <a href=\"http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/friv/birthplaces.cgi?id=13157\">David Robinson,</a> who competed in basketball. In this year&rsquo;s games there are a few athletes that hail from Florida: <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/olympics/article94752822.html\">Ashleigh Johnson</a>, competing on the U.S. Women&rsquo;s water polo team, <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/olympics/article94752822.html\">Nick Lucena</a>, a Florida State Alum competing in beach volleyball with his teammate (and won against Mexico!) along with <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/olympics/article94752822.html\">Robin Prendes</a> of Miami, racing in the lightweight men&rsquo;s four rowing competition. To bring some superior athletic motivation to your vacation lifestyle, we have created a surefire &ldquo;training plan&rdquo; from the time you arrive at our resort, to the time you&rsquo;re taking your final lap before departure to ensure a gold medal finish in epic vacationing!</p>\n<p><strong><u>The Opening Ceremony</u></strong><br /> Welcoming you to your perfect Key West getaway is our beautiful entryway, filled with the relaxing scent of burning candles and our focal point chandelier. After check-in, breeze through the tropical landscaped grounds on the way to your room. Before the &ldquo;games&rdquo; begin, take advantage of our <a href=\"http://www.themarkerkeywest.com/services---amenities/fitness-center/\">state-of-the-art fitness center</a>. In your downtime tap our <a href=\"http://www.themarkerkeywest.com/experiences/the-marker-experience/\">&ldquo;Conch&rdquo;-ierge</a> to share some of the nearby activities of Key West. From dolphin watching, to snorkeling, to dinner cruises, we&rsquo;re sure that you will find something that inspires you, after all, you&rsquo;re only steps away from the heart of Duval street!</p>\n<p><strong><u>Laps in the Pool</u></strong><br /> Take a dip in one of our three <a href=\"http://www.themarkerkeywest.com/services---amenities/pools/\">oasis pools</a>, perfect for a fun workout or a relaxing repose. In the true spirit of competition, rally up a group of friends to race across the pool! We aren&rsquo;t awarding medals, but you may be able to convince your friends to reward you with a refreshing margarita at the Cero Bodega bar. After your pool time hang out on a chaise lounge or grab a spot next to the TV at <a href=\"http://www.themarkerkeywest.com/drinks---dining/bar/\">the bar</a> for prime viewing of the athletes competing in their various sports.</p>\n<p><strong><u>The Victory Lap </u></strong><br /> What better way to finish off a successful vacation than with a victory lap, or in this case, a victory round of drinks! We are currently offering the following themed drink specials throughout the month of August at <a href=\"http://www.themarkerkeywest.com/drinks---dining/cero-bodega/\">Cero Bodega</a>. The Frozen Flag: a three-layered drink in true red, white, and blue! Featuring a layer of blue frozen Curacao atop mix of Tequila and frozen lime daiquiri, and finished off with a bottom layer of frozen strawberry daiquiri. To highlight an iconic American athlete, we have a Spiked Arnold Palmer: a chilled iced tea spiked with Deep Eddy Lemon Vodka, and Boulevard Lemon Ginger Radler. Our final drink special inspired by the 2016 Summer games is a traditional Brazilian Caiprinha, served on the rocks. We drop in two lime quarters, and muddle them with sugar. Add in Brazilian Brandy, top with ice, and enjoy!</p>\n<p>Are you as excited about the games as we are?
