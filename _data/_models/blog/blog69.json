We had a great trip and a wonderful stay at the Marker. Its location is perfect and right next to all of our planned adventures. Everyone was so friendly, we will be back to stay here. JB, Dinara, Claudel, Tim, Peter, Kadi and Tom were so helpful and made our stay even better. ~ CarrieLokey via TripAdvisor</p>\n<p><strong>Fabulous in Every Way</strong></p>\n<p>Spent a few nights at the Marker as part of a bucket list trip for our friend who has terminal cancer. It truly was fabulous in every way. JB Idinara and Claudel, from the staff, made our stay extra special even sending wine and fresh fruit to the room to welcome our friend. Beautiful pools, lovely rooms, amazing staff. Stay here you won't be sorry. Thanks again Marker staff for being part of Jeffrey's bucket list. Lori G. via TripAdvisor</p>\n<p>Thank you, thank you, thank you!!! These awards mean so much because they are based on reviews from our guests.
