Some of the cats who currently live on the museum grounds are descendants of Snow White and the polydactyl cats have full run over the residence and home.&nbsp; NOTE:&nbsp; All cats survived Hurricane Irma.</p>\n<p><strong>Wondering where Hemingway drank?</strong> Well he spent a lot of time at <a title=\"Sloppy Joe&rsquo;s Bar\" href=\"https://sloppyjoes.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sloppy Joe&rsquo;s Bar</a> at the corner of Greene Street and Front.</p>\n<p>If Hemingway were alive today we think he might be heading over to Papa's Pilar Rum Distillery, Hemingway Rum Company.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of everywhere he traveled in this world, Ernest Hemingway chose Key West to call home.

The organization has done research ranging from sunken slave ships, vessels from the earliest days of the colonial system, pirates, to Cuban refugee boats.</p>\n<p><strong>The Turtle Museum</strong></p>\n<p>They also operate a satellite museum at the old Key West turtle soup cannery that is dedicated to the turtling industry.&nbsp; Learn about the <a title=\"Key West Turtle Museum\" href=\"https://www.keywestturtlemuseum.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Key West Turtle Museum</a>. (This is a free museum open Thursday - Sunday 11am -4pm, located at 200 Margaret Street, not far from our hotel.)</p>\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Fantastic historical treasure in itself</strong> <em>I began learning about Mel Fisher's searches for sunken treasure a few decades ago through documentaries produced by National Geographic and others, but I wasn't aware of this museum until this year (2018) on a visit to Key West. I convinced my wife to go in and she was just as awestruck by the history of Fisher's life and struggles as I was years ago. Fantastic displays, short movie, a timeline history of his life, many photos, educational exhibits showing the painstaking process and stages of archaeological research, and more. Self-guided audio tours also available.&rdquo;~ Alan S., Topeka KS, via TripAdvisor</em></p>\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Behind The Scenes&rdquo; Lab Tours</strong></p>\n<p>The museum now offers one of the more interesting experiences available on the island &ndash; &ldquo;behind the scenes&rdquo; <strong>lab tours</strong> of their conservation laboratory, where ancient artifacts recovered from the seafloor are conserved, restored, and made ready for exhibition and further research. For anyone interested in history, archaeology, or plain old detective work, the laboratory tour gives a close-up view of how the museum staff works&nbsp; to unlock centuries-old underwater secrets. The organization is supported by admission fees (they do not sell artifacts from their collections), and when you tour the exhibits and laboratory, you help to move their research forward &ndash; a very good cause!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Behind The Scenes Lab Tours are offered daily at 11:30am and 2:00pm</p>\n<p><a title=\"Mel Fisher Maritime Museum\" href=\"http://www.melfisher.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mel Fisher Maritime Museum</a></p>\n<p>Admission:&nbsp; Adult $15, Student $12.50, Children $5.00,&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Lab Tour $12.50, Combo - Admission and Lab Tour $25</p>\n<p>Museum Hours:&nbsp; Mon-Fri 8:30 - 5pm, Weekends and Holidays 9:30 - 5pm (open 365 days a year)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>200 Green Street, Key West, FL&nbsp; 33040</p>\n<p>305-294-2633</p>\n<p>What are your favorite Key West Museums? #lovethemarker</p>"
