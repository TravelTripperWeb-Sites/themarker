We know there are almost as many restaurants as bars in town so today we want to spotlight three places we think you should visit on your next trip to paradise. Get ready to learn about some of the most delightful, delicious, creative and unique eateries that have already become a favorite amongst the locals. Let's dig in and learn more about MisoHappy, Lola's Bistro, and OnlyWood Restaurant.</p>\n<h3>MisoHappy</h3>\n<p>Before we start, we have to say it, OMG; this restaurant makes me sooo happy! Located off Duval on Southard Street is where you'll find Misohappy, Key West's Premier Sushi Bar with Regional and Traditional Thai Restaurant.</p>\n<p>Southard Street is really taking a new identity and becoming known for the food scene because of small to medium size restaurants like MisoHappy joining the neighborhood. The restaurant opened a year ago and has been on the top of the list for everyone who visits.</p>\n<p><img id=\"1582018217172\" class=\" \" src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,h_1200,q_auto,w_1200/v1582018212/qyyaj6wz6wgesqva60pv.jpg\" alt=\"blog\" data-image-large=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,h_1200,q_auto,w_1200/v1582018212/qyyaj6wz6wgesqva60pv.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,h_992,q_auto,w_992/v1582018212/qyyaj6wz6wgesqva60pv.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,h_768,q_auto,w_768/v1582018212/qyyaj6wz6wgesqva60pv.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,h_300,q_auto,w_300/v1582018212/qyyaj6wz6wgesqva60pv.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,g_faces,h_140,q_auto,w_140/v1582018212/qyyaj6wz6wgesqva60pv.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><br />Misohappy Lobster Pad Thai! Yes, Please! (Photo credit: MisoHappy Facebook Page)</p>\n<h3>What you can expect &hellip;</h3>\n<p>We love to share, but in this case, when you dine at MisoHappy, you might not want to share with others. The food is that good. It's fresh and deliciously prepared with a whole lot of love and happiness. I often wonder if the food looks too good to eat because it is a work of art. Portions are on the generous side also. They offer an extensive menu with Thai options on one side and sushi options on the other side, and they are open for lunch and dinner.</p>\n<h3>What people are saying&hellip;</h3>\n<p>Beautiful menu, so well developed you would think you were dining in a restaurant in New York City, but local and warm to Key West.\" - Jessica Samuels <a href=\"https://misohappyrestaurant.com/menu\">View the Miso Happy Menu</a></p>\n<p><img id=\"1582018513368\" class=\" \" src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,h_1200,q_auto,w_1200/v1582018505/dxkpge6k7zldgekqfgbg.jpg\" alt=\"blog\" data-image-large=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,h_1200,q_auto,w_1200/v1582018505/dxkpge6k7zldgekqfgbg.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,h_992,q_auto,w_992/v1582018505/dxkpge6k7zldgekqfgbg.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,h_768,q_auto,w_768/v1582018505/dxkpge6k7zldgekqfgbg.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,h_300,q_auto,w_300/v1582018505/dxkpge6k7zldgekqfgbg.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,g_faces,h_140,q_auto,w_140/v1582018505/dxkpge6k7zldgekqfgbg.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><br />From left to right: Godzilla Roll, Mexican Roll and Key West Conch Roll</p>\n<p>Our server, who's name I do not remember, was very nice and attentive. He recommended some sakes to my husband at various price points. My husband and I ordered 3 rolls: The Key West Conch Roll, The Godzilla Roll and the Mexican Roll to share. All were delicious, all were freshly prepared. Everything arrived promptly and without a hitch. Prices for the specialty rolls were a little on the high side, but the taste and freshness justified that. Would definitely come again. ~ Yesenia R., Yelp Review and Photo Credit</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://misohappyrestaurant.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MisoHappy</a> <br />504 Southard Street<br />Key West, FL 33040<br />Hours: Open for lunch and dinner from 11 am to 11 pm <br />Reservations Recommended and Suggested. <br />(305) 509-7868</p>\n<h3>Lola&rsquo;s Bistro</h3>\n<p>An Italian eclectic BYOB restaurant with a bohemian vibe!</p>\n<p><img id=\"1582018690065\" class=\" \" src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,h_1200,q_auto,w_1200/v1582018684/tfjr13ybwaifnp4pgsx7.jpg\" alt=\"blog1\" data-image-large=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,h_1200,q_auto,w_1200/v1582018684/tfjr13ybwaifnp4pgsx7.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,h_992,q_auto,w_992/v1582018684/tfjr13ybwaifnp4pgsx7.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,h_768,q_auto,w_768/v1582018684/tfjr13ybwaifnp4pgsx7.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,h_300,q_auto,w_300/v1582018684/tfjr13ybwaifnp4pgsx7.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,g_faces,h_140,q_auto,w_140/v1582018684/tfjr13ybwaifnp4pgsx7.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Chef Richard from Lola&rsquo;s Bistro getting ready to prepare your dinner with the freshest ingredients.</p>\n<h3>What to expect...</h3>\n<p>At Lola's Bistro, we do menu-less dining.

Chef Richard's creations for appetizers, entrees and Desserts are all fabulous. Best Tiramisu I've ever had in my life! It is BYOB without a cork fee, very cool if you are particular about your wine preferences, like me. The presentation is very nice as well, for example the artichoke appetizer looked like a rose on a stem. I have eaten there one time about 3 weeks ago and tonight I am going for the second time, very excited! ~ Michael G., Miami FL ~ Yelp Review</p>\n<p><img id=\"1582018809192\" class=\" \" src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,h_1200,q_auto,w_1200/v1582018804/gfhb5a5ir0vunyf0bqis.jpg\" alt=\"blog\" data-image-large=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,h_1200,q_auto,w_1200/v1582018804/gfhb5a5ir0vunyf0bqis.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,h_992,q_auto,w_992/v1582018804/gfhb5a5ir0vunyf0bqis.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,h_768,q_auto,w_768/v1582018804/gfhb5a5ir0vunyf0bqis.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,h_300,q_auto,w_300/v1582018804/gfhb5a5ir0vunyf0bqis.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,g_faces,h_140,q_auto,w_140/v1582018804/gfhb5a5ir0vunyf0bqis.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>\"Branzino topped with jumbo shrimp in lemon and capers. ~ Lola&rsquo;s Bistro</p>\n<p>Lola's Bistro is one of those places you don't want to tell people about because you want to keep it all to yourself.

BYOB</p>\n<h3>OnlyWood Pizza</h3>\n<p>Welcome to the neighborhood! How lucky we are that OnlyWood Pizza has opened a second location on Caroline Street. Why we are so excited - they are steps away from our Key West Waterfront Resort. OnlyWood Pizza's other location is tucked away in an Ally off Duval Street.</p>\n<h3>What you can expect &hellip;</h3>\n<p>The great news here is you don't have to go far get great Italian food in Key West. They are famous for the thin-crust, Neapolitan style pizza and more! Don't be fooled by the name because the restaurant is the go-to place for authentic Italian cuisine and how lucky we are; they are a 2-minute walk (if that) from our resort.</p>\n<p>This is more than a place to get pizza and pasta. It's also a great place for happy hour, cocktails, and they have a massive Woodfire grill for Steaks and Seafood! It's the place for everyone - groups, families, or just a quiet dinner for the two of you. You are welcomed to a large and airy indoor restaurant that also offers outdoor seating on the patio. Another win at OnlyWood is the bar - it's big enough that you really don't have to worry about getting a seat at the bar. As you can see, OnlyWood is another one of our favorites finds not just because they are our neighbors, but they deliver on good food, ambiance and it's another cool place to eat and drink on the island.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.onlywoodkw.com/#menu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">View the OnlyWood Pizza Menu</a></p>\n<p><img id=\"1582019104982\" class=\" \" src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,h_1200,q_auto,w_1200/v1582019098/pjwpu6r2pqbcsd62yr4l.jpg\" alt=\"Onlywood\" data-image-large=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,h_1200,q_auto,w_1200/v1582019098/pjwpu6r2pqbcsd62yr4l.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,h_992,q_auto,w_992/v1582019098/pjwpu6r2pqbcsd62yr4l.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,h_768,q_auto,w_768/v1582019098/pjwpu6r2pqbcsd62yr4l.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,h_300,q_auto,w_300/v1582019098/pjwpu6r2pqbcsd62yr4l.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,g_faces,h_140,q_auto,w_140/v1582019098/pjwpu6r2pqbcsd62yr4l.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><br />Photo Credit: Davide C. on Yelp</p>\n<h3>What people are saying...</h3>\n<p>Great new location! We always eat at Onlywood when we visit, but this was our first time to the new location on Caroline. Outstanding all around. Great selection of wines with top notch pasta, risotto, and steak. Did not have the wood-fired pizza here, but no doubt would also be wonderful. The decor was comfortable with much more room between tables than the Duval location.

Last week I had the Shrimp Saffron Risotto that was so good that we came back last night to try more. We started with the Fried Calamari, Shrimp and Zucchini. This time I had the Mushroom Fettuccine. Excellent food, wine and ambiance. Our server Eddie was so professional and friendly the first time. We requested him last night and we were happy to have him as our server. So if you go, request him. Everyone was so professional. Key Westers are very happy to have this second OnlyWood! ~ Jane La Pain, Facebook Review</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.onlywoodgrill.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OnlyWood Pizza</a></p>\n<p><br />725 Caroline Street<br />Key West, FL 33040<br />Hours: Open daily 4 pm - 10:30 pm <br />(During season hours may change so check the website for updates)</p>\n<p>Have a favorite restaurant in Key West you&rsquo;d like us to spotlight? #lovethemarker</p>",
