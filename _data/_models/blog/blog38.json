We went out for a half a day to the \"</em>back country<em>\" to find some sharks. And boy, did we find some sharks. We caught 3 huge ones - a bull and two </em>lemon<em>, and catching the bull shark took some serious strategy and strength. My arms are still sore! We, of course, released the sharks once we got our photos, and will have a story we can tell for years. We also saw a very large hammerhead shark and lots of different types of smaller fish. We had very little experience with fishing but Captain Mel didn't cut us much slack, which was awesome; he coached us as he maneuvered the boat and we were able to reel everything in on our own. I highly recommend Captain Mel! ~ SJDS15 on TripAdvisor</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Captain Mel&rsquo;s Sport Fishing Charters</p>\n<p>Key West Harbor&nbsp;</p>\n<p>6000 Peninsular Ave, Key West, Florida</p>\n<p>350-923-0365</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Need help booking a Fishing Charter in Key West?&nbsp; Check with the Concierge about which Charter is best for your adventure and while you&rsquo;re here share your favorite fishing photos with us.&nbsp; #lovethemarker</p>",
