Day or night you may be struck by a moment that melts your heart and stops you fast in your track to capture a photo of a bride and groom as they say I do and celebrate an island wedding in paradise.</p>\n<p>Surrounded by swaying palm trees, ocean breezes and blue skies it&rsquo;s no surprise that visitors flock to Key West to say I do and experience a new love while enjoying destination but today it&rsquo;s really about romance, travel, and visions of love that capture our hearts.</p>\n<h3>Just the Two of Us</h3>\n<p>Setting the scene for a beach wedding in Key West.</p>\n<p>While taking a stroll along Smathers beach one early morning this beautiful bride, groom and photographer and appear out of nowhere. Moments like these are beyond romantic as the setting and simplicity get you to stop and enjoy the view as the bride and groom say I do. Less is so much more as you can feel the love during this very intimate wedding ceremony on the beach.</p>\n<h3>A Walk in the Park</h3>\n<p><img id=\"1550644040515\" class=\" \" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1550644037/cyymwsmq8xzc6spa5jxa.jpg\" alt=\"walk-in-the-park\" data-image-large=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1550644037/cyymwsmq8xzc6spa5jxa.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_992,w_992/v1550644037/cyymwsmq8xzc6spa5jxa.jpg\" data-image-small=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_768,w_768/v1550644037/cyymwsmq8xzc6spa5jxa.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_300,w_300/v1550644037/cyymwsmq8xzc6spa5jxa.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,h_140,w_140/v1550644037/cyymwsmq8xzc6spa5jxa.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Of all the walks we&rsquo;ve taken together, today will be my favorite.</p>\n<p>Heading home after a day at the beach we were able to share another wedding experience in Key West just by being at the right place at the right time.

Little did we know it was going to be taking place at The Marker. One of the three pools - the serenity pool - was transformed into an intimate island dining experience and we think the perfect place to celebrate love and friendship.</p>\n<p>Love is in the air and surrounds our island from sunrise to sunset so don&rsquo;t be surprised if you find yourself interrupted by wedding sights and sounds during your stay. If you&rsquo;ve captured love in paradise, share it with us. #lovethemarker.</p>",
