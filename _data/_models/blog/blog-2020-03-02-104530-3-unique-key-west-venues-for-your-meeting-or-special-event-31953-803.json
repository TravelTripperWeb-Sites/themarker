In the home, you can host your own state dinner for two or one hundred. The winter White House of President Harry S. Truman is a national and Key West landmark and is available for extraordinary dinner parties.</p>\n<p>The three lawns surrounding President Harry S. Truman's winter retreat can be used together or individually. The front lawn, with tall palms and enormous tropical banyan trees, forms a garden cathedral and is a favorite location for Key West wedding ceremonies. The side lawn, shaded by a variety of tropical shade trees, lends itself to receptions and dinners. It's just right for a smaller&nbsp;party. The lush green rear lawn is open and spacious. You can choose to set up your dance floor underneath the stars or create a covered area with a large tent.</p>\n<h3>About the Harry S. Truman Little White House</h3>\n<p>The Harry S Truman Little White House was the winter White House for President Harry S Truman for 175 days during 11 visits throughout the 1940s and '50s, and it's Florida's only Presidential Museum. The house is located in Truman Annex in Old Town, Key West.</p>\n<p>The house is filled with original furnishings that were used by President Truman and reflect the decor of the 1940s and early 1950s.

They were so great to work with during the planning process and check-in was made even better. We wanted to have a group gathering room so they worked a deal with us for one of the new suites. That allowed everyone to have a central and private meeting place to hang out, discuss the daily plans and even have a small business meeting. JB was extremely helpful and text or called almost every day to check-in. All of the hotel staff from the front desk, concierge, room attendants, bartender, valet, and even groundskeepers were nothing less than professional. We absolutely love the location and atmosphere of Old Town and couldn't be happier that the Marker is here. In the past, we have stayed in houses, etc but with a group of 12-16 people, the hotel is much more accommodating and gives our customers the privacy that a group house would not. Thank you so much for the positive experience! ` ~ Kelli P., Guthrie Kentucky, TripAdvisor</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.themarkerkeywest.com/weddings-and-events/meetings/\">Contact us</a> to discuss your group travel plans and tropical getaway to paradise.</p>\n<p>Key West is an island rich in history, art and culture and no matter where you decide to have your special event, one thing is guaranteed, your guests will walk away saying this is one trip they won&rsquo;t forget and when can we go back! #lovethemarker</p>",
