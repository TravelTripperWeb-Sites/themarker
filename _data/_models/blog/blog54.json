There was four of us, we had the shrimp, beef, fish tacos, and a breakfast burrito. All of the food came with a variety of creative combinations that were mouth watering and fresh. The people working were wonderfully helpful even though they were totally slammed. I would definitely recommend eating here!: ~ Andrea Sparks, Google Review \"Great find! Really fresh and locally grown produce is used to make their food. It's atmosphere is very relaxed and away from the craziness of Duval street. The best part is they have free parking and a variety of craft beers. I recommend the bier cheese nachos I would come to Key West again for this alone. ~ Alese M., Las Cruces, NM via <a title=\"Yelp\" href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/mellow-cafe-and-gastropub-key-west-3?hrid=f7WcLRWw1W1FiZDuM2f_mQ&amp;utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&amp;utm_medium=copy_link&amp;utm_source=(direct)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yelp</a></p>\n<p>Mellow Cafe &amp; Gastropub offers another unique island fare with a laid-back, mellow atmosphere to match.

Skip the fancy place across the street. This is the REAL deal!! \"~ 570MelanieW570, Athens, Georgia via TripAdvisor</p>\n<p>What to expect when you visit Fisherman&rsquo;s Cafe?</p>\n<p>A warm and welcoming vibe, fresh, just caught seafood, tasty made-to-order specialties and the unmistakable warm feeling that comes with experiencing the authentic flavors of old Key West.</p>\n<p>Now that we filled you in on three hip cool cafe&rsquo;s in Key West we love, we highly recommend you add them to your list of places to eat and drink during your next visit. #lovethemarker</p>",
