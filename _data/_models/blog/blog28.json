The first night, we came in just for a flight and really enjoyed what they had (we kept hearing other bars talk about the crazy lady and it did not disappoint!). We then realized that we could walk right out into the dock (amazing!) and we got to see the boats pass at night. &nbsp;The next day, we came in for the brewery tour and were given a pint glass, a flight, and a pint of whatever's on tap all for $10. The tour was super informative (and interesting, who knew key west had so many laws about beer!)</p>\n<p>Brewery Tours are 5pm every Thursday and Friday and 2pm on Saturday and Sunday</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thewaterfrontbrewery.com/beers\">Learn about the Beers</a> and <a href=\"http://www.thewaterfrontbrewery.com/tours/\">Book A Brewery Tour</a></p>\n<p>Before or after the tour grab a bite to eat and enjoy the waterfront views at the historic seaport.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Waterfront Brewery</strong></p>\n<p>201 William Street, Key West, FL</p>\n<p>Open 11am - Late (yes that&rsquo;s what they say)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>305-440-2270</p>\n<h4>Food Tours</h4>\n<p><img id=\"1500445826502\" class=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/202_388_3514/media/2017-07-19-022235/game.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><em>Photo credit: Key West Food Tours</em></p>\n<p>Mixing food and culture with new and old friends in paradise. &nbsp;This 3-hour tour combines authentic Key West cuisine with the juicy history of the island. &nbsp;Welcome to Key West Food Tours, a culinary and cultural experience combined with a walking tour through Key West&rsquo;s most historic neighborhoods. &nbsp;If you are a foodie and want to know where the locals go then this culinary adventure is for you. &nbsp;Eat and drink like a local, with the locals, as you stroll through Old Town.
