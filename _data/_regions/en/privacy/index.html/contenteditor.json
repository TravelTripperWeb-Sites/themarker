As such, our privacy practices for the Site are explained in this Privacy Policy (this &ldquo;Policy&rdquo;). This Policy contains details about how we collect, use, and share information from you when you use the Site.</p><p>We may update this Policy from time to time. By using the Site, you (on behalf of yourself and your organization, if applicable) are expressly agreeing to the terms and conditions of the then-posted version of this Policy. If you do not agree with the terms and conditions of this Policy, you must immediately cease your use of the Site.</p><h4>CHANGES TO POLICY</h4><p>If any changes to this Policy affect how we treat or handle personally identifiable information (&ldquo;PII&rdquo;) already provided to us by you, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you by email (if the Hotel has a valid email address to use) and give you thirty (30) days to opt out of the changes as they pertain to such PII.</p><h4>OUR COLLECTION AND USE OF PII</h4><p>PII is generally defined as information that may be able to identify you such as, but not limited to, your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit or debit card number, social security number, bank account number or code, photograph, or age, among other things. We only collect PII that you voluntarily provide to us.</p><p>You can generally visit and browse the Site without revealing any PII to us, but some features or areas of the Site will ask or require you to provide PII to use those features or areas. For example, PII may be requested when you reserve a room through the Site, request information from the Hotel, create a user account, or enter certain contests or other promotional activities.</p><p><strong>We may use your PII to:</strong></p>    <ul><li>respond to your questions or comments;</li><li>send you room reservation confirmations and other scheduling information related to your stay as well as information on the Hotel and surrounding area;</li><li>sign you up for our email mailing list so we can send you marketing and survey communications;</li><li>verify your authority to use the Site;</li><li>enter you in Hotel contests and promotional activities;</li><li>better understand how we are doing as a business;</li><li>respond to and process requests from you for event or meeting proposals;</li><li>send you a requested copy of the Hotel&rsquo;s meetings/planner brochure;</li><li>improve the content and general administration of the Site;</li><li>troubleshoot technical problems or issues with the Site or the Hotel&rsquo;s computer systems;</li><li>conduct data analysis;</li><li>process the purchase of a Hotel gift certificate;</li><li>assist in collection efforts;</li><li>prevent fraud and/or abuse related to Hotel services;</li><li>if provided by you, your health information in order to better serve you and any special needs you have; and</li><li>through your interaction with our social media pages (and consistent with your settings for those pages) for the purposes of communicating with you and learning more about you, such as but not limited to, your activities, interests, locations, friends, and status (please be mindful that social media sites have their own terms and privacy policies that you are subject to when interacting with one of our pages).</li></ul><p><strong>OUR COLLECTION AND USE OF ANONYMOUS DATA</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Anonymous Data&rdquo; refers to general information that does not identify you personally (unlike PII), including clicks, pages views and durations, IP address, referral links, use of particular services, and interest in services, information or features of the Site or other parties made available through or found at the Site. Anonymous Data is automatically collected by our servers when you visit the Site, including through the use of technology such as cookies and web beacons. We may use and share Anonymous Data as we deem useful in our sole discretion, including to operate, maintain, develop, market and improve the Site, our Hotel, and our services.</p><p>The Site uses cookies. Cookies are small files that are sent to your computer when you visit the Site. Cookies allow us and/or our advertising/marketing vendors to recognize your Internet browser when you subsequently return to the Site. Cookies also collect your user preferences when you visit the Site. We do not use cookies to obtain PII.</p><p>The Hotel or our advertising/marketing vendors also use cookies to: (1) assist with processing your Site room reservation requests; (2) customize the Site and other Site offerings to your needs; (3) provide you with a more enjoyable Site experience; and (4) track and measure your Site usage for each page so we can make improvements to the Site.</p><p>We use both session cookies (temporary files that are deleted when you close your browser) and persistent cookies (files that stay on your computer until you delete them or they expire).</p><p>We also use third party advertising technology to serve Hotel advertisements to you on other sites. The technology gathers anonymous data about your Site visits and visits to other sites where Hotel advertisements appear in order to serve you with Hotel advertisements on third party sites. When these advertisements are served to you, third party persistent cookies may be put on your computer.</p><p>For example, we use AdRoll (www.adroll.com, https://www.adroll.com/about/privacy) to serve you customized advertisements on third party sites based on your interaction with the Site. As you browse the Site, advertising cookies will be placed on your computer so that we can understand what you are interested in. Our display advertising partner, AdRoll, then enables us to present you with retargeting advertising on other sites based on your previous interaction with the Site. The techniques our partners employ do not collect PII. You can visit https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ to opt out of AdRoll and its partners&rsquo; targeted advertising.</p><p>The Hotel, through its third party advertising/marketing vendors, may also use pixel tags to collect Anonymous Data. The pixel tags are computer coding usually fixed to Site pages or emails that allows our vendors to anonymously collect certain pieces of information. The Hotel, in conjunction with our advertising/marketing and email vendors, may use pixel tags to:</p><ul><li>Allow our advertising/marketing vendors to recognize cookies on your browser when you visit the Site.&nbsp; This assists our advertising/marketing vendors with determining if you reached the Site by clicking on a specific ad and/or to track your responses to Hotel advertisements served on third party sites.&nbsp; It may also reveal if a Site reservation was executed.</li><li>Determine your technical ability to receive HTML emails.&nbsp; The pixel tag allows us to know if an email sent to you is opened and marks email addresses as ones that can receive HTML emails.</li><li>Determine how many users open a specific email.&nbsp; This allows us or our email vendor to collect anonymous and aggregated statistics about a specific email blast or campaign.</li><li>Allow us or our third party advertising/marketing vendors to deliver targeted advertising on third party sites.</li><li>Allow us to make the Site more usable and make our customer support better.</li><li>Allow us to deliver to you promotional materials, offers, and other information that we believe would be relevant.</li></ul><p>You may set or configure your browser to block or disable cookies. Please review your browser instructions for details on that. Please note that by disabling cookies, this could affect your use of the Site and/or restrict your interaction with the Site. Please note that our advertising/marketing vendors may handle &ldquo;do not track&rdquo; requests differently from the Hotel.</p><p><strong>SHARING OF PII</strong></p><p>Except as noted in this Policy, we do not sell or share your PII with any person or entity outside of the Hotel and the management company for the Hotel.
